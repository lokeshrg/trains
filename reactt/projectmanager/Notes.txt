React, ReactDOM.render
Component, {Component} in import
this.props,
this.refs -> to the event handler, bind 'this' - eg. AddProjects Line 31, 20

angular scope, rootScope, components - React props, refs



each component has its own state
state is immutable - set and reset ?

React does not save data - only UI - V in MVC
but pass the state using a function in the props



to create stateless component:
create a regular function that returns JSX/React.createElement

async/await are preferred over simple promise chains  mainly due to readability/maintainability

to work with other libraries like jQuery - for it to find components, ReactDOM.findDomNode and pass the component
